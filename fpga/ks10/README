
This is revision 0.0.1 of the KS10 FPGA Code.

It is mostly configured for running instruction set
diagnostics and not much else.  I haven't sythesized
it in a long time and it probably will need some work
before it will synthesize.  I'm still mostly trying
to get it to simulate and get familar with the KS10
design.  First things first!

For status see the file ./status.txt

The KS10 console provides the starting address for the
KS10 CPU.  For now this is hardwired by some code
in the console.  To change the starting address, change
the code in ./cons/cons.v.   In that file you will find
a line (approximately line 100) that looks like:

assign busDATAO = busACKO ? 36'o254000030600 : 36'bx;

Where 36'o254000030600 is a PDP10 instruction.  I.e.,
"254000030600" is a JRST to address 30600.  See notes
in that file.

The following diagnostics have the following starting
addresses:

  MAINDEC-10-DSKAA.txt
  MAINDEC-10-DSKAB.txt
  MAINDEC-10-DSKAC.txt
  MAINDEC-10-DSKAD.txt
  MAINDEC-10-DSKAE.txt
  MAINDEC-10-DSKAF.txt
  MAINDEC-10-DSKAG.txt
  MAINDEC-10-DSKAH.txt
    Starting address 030600

  MAINDEC-10-DSKAI.txt
  MAINDEC-10-DSKAJ.txt
  MAINDEC-10-DSKAK.txt
    Starting address 030624

I have been using cygwin and windows to do development
on this.  You'll need 'make' and 'awk' to do much
development.  I also use 'rcs' for configuration
management.  You will note RCS directories in the
directory tree - but unless you're interested in history
you can ignore the RCS files.

To change the diagnostic program that is being executed:

(1) edit the makefile and change the line:
    LOAD := MAINDEC-10-DSKAK.txt
    to whatever MAINDEC you'd like to run.
(2) Execute make.  Make will extract the Control ROM
    code and Dispatch ROM code from the microcode
    listing file.  It will also extract the executable
    from the MAINDEC listing file.

This .tgz file is configured to execute MAINDEC-10-DSKAA.

To run the simultion is Xilinx ISE webpack (GUI):

(1) install ISE per Xilinx Instructions
(2) Start ISE Project Navigator
(3) Open  KS10.xise project (File->Open Project)
    KS10.xise is in ../ise

Have fun.  If you have questions contact me.

I'll add instructions on how to run the simulator later.
There is a waveform configuration file "ks10.wcfg" in
the ISE that I use for viewing simulation results.
