# ASM10

This is a little bitty barely useful PDP10 assembler.

On occasion it is useful to generate PDP10 code for debugging hardware.

I've made some minor changes from his original verision to support
KS10-specific opcodes and to support a CPP comment character (so I can use
the "C" language macro pre-processor).
